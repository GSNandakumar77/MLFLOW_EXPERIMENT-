📊 MLflow Experiments – Housing Price & Deep Learning

This repository contains two example projects demonstrating how to use MLflow for experiment tracking, model management, and reproducibility. The goal of this repo is to learn MLflow in a practical, hands-on way using both a regression task (housing price prediction) and a deep learning task (ANN model).

🚀 Projects Included
🏠 Housing Price Prediction

Uses regression techniques to predict housing prices.

Tracks parameters, metrics, and artifacts using MLflow.

Demonstrates MLflow integration with scikit-learn models.

🤖 Deep Learning with ANN

Implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

Logs training metrics and loss curves to MLflow.

Showcases MLflow with deep learning workflows.

⚙️ Features

📂 MLflow Tracking for both classical ML & deep learning

🗂️ Experiment logging: parameters, metrics, artifacts

🔄 Reproducible ML pipelines

🧪 Jupyter notebooks for interactive learning
